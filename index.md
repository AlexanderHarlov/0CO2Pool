# 0CO2 Pool
## Let's fight the global warming and CO2 in the atmosphere by stacking the cryptocurrency of the future - Cardano

### What is this ? 
This is my own Cardano Stake Pool. I am a software developer, who believes in the future of cryptocurrencies, especially in Cardano. In order for the network to exist and work, stake pools must operate in order to process transactions and mint new ADA coins. Anyone can participate in these pools, delegating part of their ADA, receiving a reward for this at the end of each epoch (5 days). Stake pool operators ensure the decentralization of the system - this is one of the reasons I started this node. The other is that I believe in eco-friendly cryptocurrency - Cardano is a Proof-Of-Stake cryptocurrency, meaning it requires less resources than the Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies. To ensure even more impact, I will donate 15% of this pool yearly income to startups/companies doing R&D on cleaning the athmosphere from CO2 (carbon dioxide).
